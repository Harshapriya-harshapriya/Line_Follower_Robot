# Line_Follower_Robot
The Line Follower Robot is a simple robot which follows a black line having some particular width on a light coloured surface. The robot uses two CNY70 sensors in order to calculate the reflectance of the surface under them. The basic idea is that the black line has a lesser reflectance value than the lighter surface. The low reflectance value is used as a parameter to detect the position of the line by the robot and the higher reflectance value will be the surface around the line. In the array of sensors, if the leftmost sensor shows the low reflectance value then the black line is towards the left of the robot likewise for the righmost sensor also correspondingly. At that point the controller makes up for this by flagging the robot to go the other way of the line.
